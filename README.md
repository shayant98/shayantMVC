# shayantMVC Mini PHP Framework

Mini PHP framework created by Brad Traversy through his udemy course. Customized by me and used as base for integrating and testing new technologies.

### Disclaimer
It's not advisable to use this for live projects as this is still an alpha project I'm using to learn and exercise. If you are inclined to help with bugs corrections and developing new features you are free to do so.

## Getting Started
Copy the project in your folder and install the database dump in your PhpMyAdmin. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.

## Prerequisites

- Apache Server
- PHP 7.2( might work with **<** 7.2, but is not tested )
- MySQL

Install [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/ "MAMP") for quickstart
